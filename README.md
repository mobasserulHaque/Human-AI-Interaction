### Method 1: Grad-CAM

**Explanation 1**

>Children’s book explaining the method to a toddler

This children’s book, *“Grady the Camera Learns to See,”* explains **Grad-CAM** in a fun and simple way. Grady, a friendly robot camera, represents a convolutional neural network that highlights which parts of an image it focuses on using red “attention” areas. 

I wanted to make **explainability** feel human, so I added a teacher and kids to show **human-AI collaboration** and **transparency** in action. The story shows how seeing what the model “looks at” helps people trust it more, turning a complex concept into something even a child could enjoy and understand.
